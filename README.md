# Setting up the .venv:

1. Go to either of the python files
2. In the bottom right on VSCode, you should see the version of python being run (ex. 3.9 or 3.11.1)
3. Click the version
4. When selecting interpreter, click "Create virtual environment"
5. If there is already an active venv, click "delete and recreate"
6. Select the appropriate version of Python (probably 3.11+)
7. Select the requirements.txt and click "ok"
8. Wait for the venv to build
9. Done!
